# Team Name
Trashy Playgrounds

# Datasets
The datasets that we used in our project were City of Pittsburgh Playgrounds, Smart Trash Containers, and Pittsburgh Neighborhoods.

# Metric
The metric we came up with to define "bestness" was density of smart trashcans and playgrounds in a given neighborhood. The neighborhood with the most trashcans/playgrounds per square miles was deemed the best.

# Results
Trashcans: The neighborhood that has the most smart trashcans per square miles is North Shore.

Playgrounds: The neighborhood that has the most playgrounds per square miles is Allegheny Center.

# Conclusion
Based on our measure of "bestness," the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh is Crawford-Roberts!
